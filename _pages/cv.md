## Summary

Soon to graduate MSc AI candidate in a cooperative program between Vrije Universiteit (VU) and Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA), with a strong foundation in Generative AI, Scientific Machine Learning and Geometric Deep Learning. Currently researching for my thesis, *Generative AI for Graphs*, and actively seeking a PhD position for Spring 2025.

Proven expertise in developing advanced AI models, including a 25x speedup in molecule generation featured at ICML 2024's GRaM Workshop, and a benchmark on physical plausibility of video generated models (under review ICCV 2025), demonstrating a commitment to pushing the boundaries of research in AI.
