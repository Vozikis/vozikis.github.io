Hi and welcome! 

My primary research interests lie in **Generative AI**, **Geometric Deep Learning** and **Foundation Models**. I hold a Master's in **Artificial Intelligence** from Vrije Universiteit (VU), in collaboration with Universiteit van Amsterdam (UvA) (Grade 8.5/10). My thesis research focused on Generative AI Architectures for Structured Graphs, received a 9/10.

I am a graduate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** with a lifelong passion for Mathematics. From a young age, I found joy in solving mathematical problems, which driven by curiosity,led me into the field of AI.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in my research, I enjoy reading a wide range of books, indulging in a good cup of coffee, and taking long walks in nature. These activities not only provide relaxation but also inspire new ideas and perspectives.
