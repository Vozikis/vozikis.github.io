Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi and welcome! 

I am a graduate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** with a lifelong passion for mathematics. From a young age, I found joy in solving mathematical problems, which led me to work as a mathematics and programming tutor. Following my instincts and curiosity, I pursued a **Master's in Artificial Intelligence** at VU Amsterdam, where I have been deeply engaged in exploring the vast potentials of AI.

My primary research interests include Dynamical Systems, Generative AI, and all facets of Deep Learning and Neural Networks. I am fascinated by the ways in which AI can revolutionize various fields and solve intricate problems, driving innovation and efficiency.

When I'm not immersed in my research, I enjoy reading a wide range of books, indulging in a good cup of coffee, and taking long walks in nature. These activities not only provide relaxation but also inspire new ideas and perspectives.
