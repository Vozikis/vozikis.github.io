Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi and welcome! 

My primary research interests include Dynamical Systems, Generative AI, and all facets of Deep Learning and Neural Networks. Currently in the process of acquiring a Master's in **Artificial Intelligence** at VU Amsterdam, where I am deeply engaged in exploring the vast potentials of AI. This summer, I am interning at CWI,  the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands, focusing on research and implementation of AI in maritime engine systems, blending my passion for innovation with real-world applications.

I am a graduate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** with a lifelong passion for mathematics. From a young age, I found joy in solving mathematical problems, which led me to work as a mathematics and programming tutor. Following my instincts and curiosity, I have shifted my trajectory into the field of AI, pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in my research, I enjoy reading a wide range of books, indulging in a good cup of coffee, and taking long walks in nature. These activities not only provide relaxation but also inspire new ideas and perspectives.
