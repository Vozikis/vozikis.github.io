Excited to have completed my research project at <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/">CWI</a>, where I designed the entire pipeline, explored cutting-edge techniques, combining deep learning models with SHAP values and large language models to transform black-box predictions into actionable maintenance insights. It feels incredibly rewarding to see my hard work come together, especially in such an innovative application of AI!Check my work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/en/people/eric-pauwels/">Eric Pauwels</a> here <a href="https://github.com/Vozikis/Aircraft-Sensors-Experiment/blob/master/CWI%20Researh%20Project.pdf">CWI Research Project</a>
